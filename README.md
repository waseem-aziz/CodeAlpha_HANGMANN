# CodeAlpha_HANGMANN

ðŸš€ Excited to Share My First Python Programming Task at CodeAlpha ! ðŸš€



For my latest project as a Python Programming Intern at CodeAlpha,
I developed a Hangman Game using Python. This project focused on 
creating a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to guess 
a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the game:



ðŸŽ® Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Players can input guesses and receive feedback on their progress.

Word Bank: Randomly selects words from a predefined list for each new game.

Visual Representation: Displays the current state of the word and the number of incorrect guesses.

Game Over Conditions: Ends the game when the word is guessed correctly or the maximum number of incorrect guesses is reached.

Efficient and User-Friendly: Provides a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving any user data.

Looking forward to more exciting challenges and learning opportunities at CodeAlpha! Stay tuned for more updates.
